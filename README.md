## Welcome!

First and foremost, like anything we build, this is a work in progress which will only become better (hopefully) with time.

In general, the goal of the site itself was to sell my visitors on my talent by providing a simple, minimalistic experience. Keywords here: "simple" and "minimalistic". As you will see, these keywords are the backbone of the experience.

I wanted a simple design so that no one would get lost or confused. I accomplished this with a few techniques: navigation, arrows, buttons, and a timeline.

The navigation itself is clear and fixed. The user can access it an point within the application and the options are limited. I used arrows to make it clear to the visitor that "there is more" which avoided any chance that the user would simply miss it. My buttons were large and obvious. I used animations to invite the user to "click me".

Lastly, I used a timeline to clearly map the most important information in a very simple intuitive way. Often times, when I see other website's display their portfolio, the information you are looking for is obscure and it is riddled with confusing links that take you away. However, with the timeline, I clearly detailed everything you wanted to know and provided the links on separate tabs to keep visitors engaged.

To tie in the simplicity of the application, I used minimalistic techniques to keep my visitors focused and calm. I primarily stuck with neutral colors. I find that these colors are calming and clear to the visitor. I then coupled my neutrals, with a light shade of burgundy to bring excitement and focus to my visitors. I often paired this color with buttons and arrows to give visitors direction. I used large fonts to make it easy for users to read and to understand where they are. Lastly, I used bold fonts to draw attention to specific details within the application.

I believe, these are the techniques and stylistic choices I took to keep all my visitors engaged, excited, and informed. Thank you for being here and I hope this brought to light why I did what I did.

If you have any questions for me, please email me anytime. If you find any issues with the site or want to suggest something new, please open up an issue.

Thanks!
